# Object-detection-for-self-driving-car-using-YOLO-framework(You Only Look Once)

**Project Objective**:The objective of this project is to develop a real-time AI system that detects important road objects and estimates their distance to enhance safety and collision warning capabilities.

It aims to integrate object detection, distance estimation, and performance analytics into a single intelligent dashboard system. 

**Project Overview**:This project is a real-time AI-based Object Detection and Distance Estimation System built using YOLOv8 and PyQt.

The system detects important road objects such as cars, pedestrians, buses, trucks, traffic lights, and stop signs using deep learning. It also estimates the approximate distance of detected objects using monocular vision techniques.

The project includes:

✅ Real-time object detection using YOLOv8

✅ Distance estimation using bounding box geometry

✅ Collision alert system with sound warning

✅ Multithreaded processing for smooth performance

✅ FPS, CPU, and RAM monitoring

✅ Object counting and graphical analytics dashboard

✅ Support for webcam, image, video, and mobile camera input

This system can be applied in autonomous driving, smart surveillance, and AI-based safety systems.
